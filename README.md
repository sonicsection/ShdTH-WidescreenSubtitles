<h1 align="center"><strong>Shadow the Hedgehog: Widescreen Subtitles</strong></h1>

![Widescreen_Subtitles](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/SEU-ID-AQUI/IMAGEM-AQUI.png)

<p align="center">
  The <strong>Widescreen Subtitles</strong> were designed to be a cleaner and improved subtitle system for the widescreen version of <strong>Shadow the Hedgehog Reloaded</strong>.<br>
  This mod removes all <em>hint balls</em> and keeps only the core story dialogue of the game.
</p>

## Overview

There are two available versions:

- <strong>With HUD</strong>: Keeps the default game HUD while improving the subtitles.
- <strong>No HUD</strong>: Removes all HUD elements for a fully cinematic experience.

Originally, there was supposed to be a single version. However, due to current technical limitations that prevent HUD elements from being repositioned to the sides of the screen, both versions were created separately.

> All modifications were made using the <strong>ShadowTH Text Editor</strong>.

I do not plan to release a version with hint balls, as they are considered unnecessary for the intended experience.

## What's Included

- `With HUD` and `No HUD` folders with subtitle files.
- **Reloaded 1.2 Level Files**, which removes hint balls in stages without bosses.
- Compatible and recommended for use with [Ultimate Mode](https://github.com/sonicsection/ShdTH-UltimateMode), enhancing the overall gameplay experience.
