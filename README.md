<p align="center">
  The <strong>Widescreen Subtitles</strong> were designed to be an improved and cleaner subtitle for the widescreen version of <strong>Shadow Reloaded</strong>. <br>
  This mod removes all <em>hint balls</em> and keeps only the core story dialogue of the game.
</p>

## Overview

There are two available versions:

- <strong>With HUD</strong>: Keep the game's default HUD, just replacing the files in "fonts" folder with the files in "fonts (With HUD)" folder
- <strong>No HUD</strong>: Activate the code below to remove all HUD elements, and replacing the files in "fonts" folder with the files in "fonts (No HUD)" folder.

Originally, there was supposed to be a single version. However, due to current technical limitations that prevent HUD elements from being repositioned to the sides of the screen, both versions were created separately. I do not plan to release a version with hint balls, as they are considered unnecessary for the intended experience.

## What's Included

- `With HUD` and `No HUD` folders with subtitle files.
- **Reloaded 1.2 Level Files**, which removes hint balls in stages without bosses.
- Compatible and recommended for use with [Ultimate Mode](https://github.com/sonicsection/ShdTH-UltimateMode), enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

## Installation Note

It is recommended to apply this mod over the latest version of [Shadow Reloaded](https://github.com/ShadowTheHedgehogHacking/ShdTH-Reloaded) Widescreen to ensure compatibility.
> All subtitle modifications were made using [ShadowTH Text Editor](https://github.com/ShadowTheHedgehogHacking/ShadowTHTextEditor), and [Heroes Power Plant](https://github.com/igorseabra4/HeroesPowerPlant) to modify the stages, removing all hint balls.
